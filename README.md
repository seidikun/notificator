# notificator
A ready to use module in python so you can get messages sent from your code to a notify_run channel

I made it so I can get notifications from any computer or code that takes sometimes to run a python code.
Just instantiate a notificator object and it will create a notify-run channel. Then use send_msg function to send a message to this channel
